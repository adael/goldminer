Senses (see, listen, feel)

    An actor sees things when enter in his sight range but only if his
    awareness is 100% (which will never be).
    There's a chance to notice things in his sight range. If an actor notices
    something, it will "see" that.

    When other actor enter in his sight range, the visibility of the other
    actor will affect. If an actor sees another, then it will appear in
    his history the following text:

        "Actor" sees other actor

    If the reason for viewing other actor is because the other actor has
    made some noise the history will be

        "Actor" ears other actor

    Then there's a chance to see it (if it's possible) and then will follow
    with

        "Actor" sees other actor

    If the action it's another, for example, an abrupt movement or attack
    the it will appears in the history as:

        "Actor" sees other actor "attacking <target>"
        "Actor" sees other actor "jumping"
