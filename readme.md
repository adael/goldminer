This game it's not playable yet, I'll remove this message when you can have some fun playing this game.
As it's common, I'm doing this mainly for learning.

# Introduction

You are a very poor, alone and hungry individual with the life goal of make a fortune searching for gold in an hostile
world. Your first quest is to make you a pickaxe. Let's go digging.
